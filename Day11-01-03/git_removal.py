Centralised Virtual Control System (VCS) - Multiple clients will get connected through a server.
	Drawback: You need a server/internet. If anything goes with the server there is no backup.

Distributed VCS - It keeps a track of people and all the changed made. 
	Repository = Repo or server. Multiple work stations can be connected and it makes a local copy of whatever file you have (on your system)
	# No internet connectivity is required. Internet is required to get the file and to upload the files.
	# ALready there is a backup on local device even if server is creahsed.
	# To track
	# To collaborate - It is all done by GITS - Its an Open source

Continuous Integration (CI) - These are not single applicaitons, these are micro application compiled alltogether. E.g - Different level of games.

As a developer - Code to fix bugs, issues, security breach and follow up on feedback.
